Description : This is a Java Program that shows if a set of documents are about the same topic or not.
the program will scan the words of the documents and check ifthere are common words between the documents which should then 
declare that these documents are similar.stop words for example like the , a , of , he etc should be excluded from the analysis.

the program should open the two files first, then it should scan and read the files line by line. A catch function that allows to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block sould be created when reaing the files and then it should return the lines.when all of that is done the program should compare the two files.


the file reader class
this is where object of the files should be created to call the two files 


by using the isEqual function, we can check if the topics of file 1 and file2 are equal or not. we are going to use an if statement for this. if the two files has the same topics then it should print it has same topicsotherwise it should print different topics.
